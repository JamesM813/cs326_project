        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Trivia fun is a web application aimed to foster an engaging and
          entertaining environment that allows people to challenge friends in
          testing each other's knowledge. With the immense amount of information
          available on the internet, it is a difficult task to navigate all the
          different things the world has to offer in terms of knowledge. Our web
          app quizzes users on various topics ranging from a bunch of different
          categories such as history, math, science, etc. Our trivia game is
          tasked to solve this problem by providing a structured and
          entertaining way to teach players new things by expanding their
          knowledge in a competitive environment. Our goal is to target trivia
          enthusiasts or anyone enjoying a friendly competition in hopes of
          expanding their knowledge in any specific topic. By offering a diverse
          number of categories to quiz people that vary in difficulty, we are
          able to cater to a broad audience in utilizing this web app.
          Ultimately, users will be able to quiz themselves individually or play
          with friends to compete on their knowledge.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="application-parts">
        <h2>Application Parts</h2>
        <div>
          Categories are a big part of Trivia Fun as they allow users to test
          their knowledge on various topics such as science, math, history, etc.
          The categories part of the application utilizes a dropdown box where
          users can select a topic they would like to be quizzed on and will
          also have a search feature to easily find the topic. This allows for
          us to cater to a more broader audience, ensuring that our web app is
          applicable to everyone.
        </div>
        <div>
          The leaderboard serves an important part of Trivia Fun by tracking
          everyone's performance on their trivia knowledge, contributing to a
          competitive yet enjoyable environment.
        </div>
        <div>
          The Questions Screen will be one of the most important parts for our
          web app to work as it presents the trivia questions to the user to
          test their knowledge on a certain topic. The questions format will
          mostly consist of multiple choice and there will be a timer for each
          question.
        </div>
        <div>
          The results screen notifies the user of performance on the trivia game
          and also places them on the leaderboard based off their score. There
          will be stats on the user's performance such as time taken to answer.
        </div>
      </section>
      <section id="data-management">
        <h2>Data Requirements</h2>

        <p>
          When designing any website, it's crucial to consider the various types
          of data that the application will handle, in our case a trivia site.
          From user profiles to quiz questions, each piece of data plays a
          significant role in providing an engaging and seamless experience for
          users. We want this not only to be a website that functions well, but
          beyond that a place for people to have fun and learn. That starts with
          a foundation of data management, so it is important to explore the top
          types of data that our trivia application will manage.
        </p>

        <h3>User Profiles</h3>
        <p>
          One of the primary data requirements for our trivia website is user
          profiles. Each user will have a unique profile containing information
          such as username, profile pictures and personal preferences. User
          profiles are essential for personalized experiences, tracking
          progress, and facilitating social interactions, such as adding friends
          or competing on leaderboards. We can also store data about a user's
          wishes for customization, so every user can have their own unique feel
          on our site.
        </p>

        <h3>Quiz Questions and Answers</h3>
        <p>
          The core content of our trivia website revolves around quiz questions
          and answers. These data points include the actual questions posed to
          users, multiple-choice options, correct answers, and any additional
          metadata such as difficulty level or category tags. Ensuring a diverse
          collection of questions is crucial for keeping users engaged and
          challenged. We would obviously have to make sure that we get data from
          reliable sources, citing where we get any specific information both to
          avoid any plagiarism and to allow users to explore more if they want.
          I imagine a way to handle this would just have a "Source" button when
          an answer is provided, and then the user can learn more on their own.
        </p>

        <h3>Categories and Tags</h3>
        <p>
          To enhance user experience and facilitate navigation, our trivia
          application will organize quiz questions and other content into
          categories and tags. Categories provide a broad classification of
          topics, such as history, science, or entertainment, while tags offer
          more specific descriptors, allowing users to filter content based on
          their interests. I'd imagine tags could be "United States History" or
          "Taylor Swift Song Lyrics". Properly structured categories and tags
          not only make it easier for users to find relevant quizzes and
          questions instead of just throwing an assortment of random questions
          at the user.
        </p>

        <h3>Leaderboard Data</h3>
        <p>
          Tracking user performance and displaying high scores is a key feature
          of our trivia website. It's one thing to quiz yourself, but adding the
          competitive aspect that trivia is known for. Leaderboard data includes
          user rankings based on various criteria, such as total points earned,
          accuracy rates, or completion times. In addition to individual
          rankings, the leaderboard may also feature global, regional, or
          friend-specific rankings to encourage competition and social
          interaction. Efficient data storage and retrieval mechanisms are
          important to ensure real-time updates and accurate representations of
          user achievements (if possible).
        </p>

        <p>
          In conclusion, the success of our trivia website depends heavily on
          effectively managing various types of data. By prioritizing user
          profiles, quiz questions, categories, tags, and leaderboard data, we
          can create a dynamic and engaging platform that provides users with an
          enjoyable trivia experience while also facilitating social interaction
          and competition.

            The questions wireframe will display the current question, its
            category, and answer choices, containing the information that is
            most important, as the user is in the process of playing, in an
            easy-to-read manner. It will also include a timer showing the
            remaining time along the bottom so the user can keep track of their
            speed.

            selecting their topic of preference. There will also be a search
            bar, making it quicker for the user to select a category, such as if
            they already know the category name, without having to go through
            all the options.

        <h2>Real-World Connection</h2>
        <p>
          In an increasingly interconnected world, encouraging engagement and
          knowledge-sharing is crucial. Our trivia website addresses the need
          for accessible and enjoyable recreational activities while promoting
          learning and community interaction. Just like how social media
          platforms connect individuals globally, our website aims to create a
          virtual space where people can come together to test their knowledge,
          engage in friendly competition, and deepen their understanding of
          various topics. This would especially be the case for smaller friend
          groups or spaces. Consider the example of a group of friends gathering
          for a trivia night at a local bar. Especially in the context of our
          college town, these can be limited by timing, age, transportation,
          conflicts, etc. Our website transcends these limitations by providing
          an online platform where users can participate in trivia games
          anytime, anywhere. Whether it's a group of friends spread across
          different cities or strangers with shared interests, our website
          brings people together in a fun and educational way. Moreover, our
          trivia website can serve as a valuable educational tool, especially
          for students. There could be situations where teachers could use our
          site as a fun but educational tool. Additionally, users can explore
          new topics and expand their knowledge through trivia quizzes tailored
          to their interests. By leveraging technology to facilitate learning
          and social interaction, our trivia website contributes to the
          trivia-itch of our users that we all know we get, mayble teach some
          people a few things, and also hopefully create a community to bring
          people together.

      <section id="integrative-experience">
        <h2>Integrative Experience</h2>
        <p>
          The development of our trivia website will show for our education and
          collective personal experiences, using concepts that we as a group
          have all gained from various courses and reflecting our growth as
          students and developers. Throughout our coursework, we've gained
          expertise in web development, database management, and user experience
          design. Courses in programming languages, such as JavaScript and
          Python, provided us with the technical skills needed to build
          interactive features and implement game logic. Importantly, not all of
          us have taken the exact same course path, giving us all slightly
          different backgrounds akin to what you would see in a real-life job.
          Moreover, our personal experiences, including participation in things
          like trivia events and online gaming have inspired possible features
          and "visions" for our project. Drawing from these experiences, we
          understand the importance of fostering a sense of community and
          creating a platform that caters to diverse interests and preferences.
