            <h2>Data Requirements</h2>

            <p>When designing any website, it's crucial to consider the various types of data that the application will handle, in our case a trivia site. From user profiles to quiz questions, each piece of data plays a significant role in providing an engaging and seamless experience for users. We want this not only to be a website that functions well, but beyond that a place for people to have fun and learn. That starts with a foundation of data management, so it is important to explore the top types of data that our trivia application will manage.</p>

            <h3>User Profiles</h3>
            <p>One of the primary data requirements for our trivia website is user profiles. Each user will have a unique profile containing information such as username, profile pictures and personal preferences. User profiles are essential for personalized experiences, tracking progress, and facilitating social interactions, such as adding friends or competing on leaderboards. We can also store data about a user's wishes for customization, so every user can have their own unique feel on our site.</p>

            <h3>Quiz Questions and Answers</h3>
            <p>The core content of our trivia website revolves around quiz questions and answers. These data points include the actual questions posed to users, multiple-choice options, correct answers, and any additional metadata such as difficulty level or category tags. Ensuring a diverse collection of questions is crucial for keeping users engaged and challenged. We would obviously have to make sure that we get data from reliable sources, citing where we get any specific information both to avoid any plagiarism and to allow users to explore more if they want. I imagine a way to handle this would just have a "Source" button when an answer is provided, and then the user can learn more on their own.</p>

            <h3>Categories and Tags</h3>
            <p>To enhance user experience and facilitate navigation, our trivia application will organize quiz questions and other content into categories and tags. Categories provide a broad classification of topics, such as history, science, or entertainment, while tags offer more specific descriptors, allowing users to filter content based on their interests. I'd imagine tags could be "United States History" or "Taylor Swift Song Lyrics". Properly structured categories and tags not only make it easier for users to find relevant quizzes and questions instead of just throwing an assortment of random questions at the user.</p>

            <h3>Leaderboard Data</h3>
            <p>Tracking user performance and displaying high scores is a key feature of our trivia website. It's one thing to quiz yourself, but adding the competitive aspect that trivia is known for. Leaderboard data includes user rankings based on various criteria, such as total points earned, accuracy rates, or completion times. In addition to individual rankings, the leaderboard may also feature global, regional, or friend-specific rankings to encourage competition and social interaction. Efficient data storage and retrieval mechanisms are important to ensure real-time updates and accurate representations of user achievements (if possible).</p>

            <p>In conclusion, the success of our trivia website depends heavily on effectively managing various types of data. By prioritizing user profiles, quiz questions, categories, tags, and leaderboard data, we can create a dynamic and engaging platform that provides users with an enjoyable trivia experience while also facilitating social interaction and competition.</p>
